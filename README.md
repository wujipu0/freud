In honor of First Contact Day 2024, I'm posting this SillyTavern chat between
myself and an AI version of Sigmund Freud discussing the symbolism of cigars,
AI alignment, Star Wars, etc. in a infinity-category theory framework.

It's based on an earlier discussion I had with ChatGPT about
Chuang Tzu's Butterfly Dream
(https://github.com/wujipu0/chuang-tzu-butterfly-dream),
epistemic modal logic, and higher categories.
